## Intro

This package is a Node.js TypeScript wrapper around [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt) by [OpenAI](https://openai.com).

## Auth

It uses headless Chromium via [Playwright](https://playwright.dev) under the hood, so **you still need to have access to ChatGPT**, but it makes it much easier to build experiments with until OpenAPI's official API for ChatGPT is released.

The first time you run `ChatGPTAPI`.init, Chromium will be opened in non-headless mode so you can log in manually. After the first time, Chromium is launched with a persistent context, so you shouldn't need to keep re-logging in.

## Usage

```ts
async function example() {
const api = new ChatGPTAPI()

// open chromium and wait until the user has logged in
await api.init({ auth: 'blocking' })

// send a message and wait for a complete response, then parse it as markdown
const response = await api.sendMessage(
  'Write a python version of bubble sort. Do not include example usage.'
)

/* // response
Here is an implementation of bubble sort in Python:

\`\`\`python
def bubble_sort(lst):
  # Set the initial flag to True to start the loop
  swapped = True

  # Keep looping until there are no more swaps
  while swapped:
    # Set the flag to False initially
    swapped = False

    # Loop through the list
    for i in range(len(lst) - 1):
      # If the current element is greater than the next element,
      # swap them and set the flag to True
      if lst[i] > lst[i + 1]:
        lst[i], lst[i + 1] = lst[i + 1], lst[i]
        swapped = True

  # Return the sorted list
  return lst
\`\`\`
*/
```

Here's the same response rendered as markdown:

Here is an implementation of bubble sort in Python:

```python
def bubble_sort(lst):
  # Set the initial flag to True to start the loop
  swapped = True

  # Keep looping until there are no more swaps
  while swapped:
    # Set the flag to False initially
    swapped = False

    # Loop through the list
    for i in range(len(lst) - 1):
      # If the current element is greater than the next element,
      # swap them and set the flag to True
      if lst[i] > lst[i + 1]:
        lst[i], lst[i + 1] = lst[i + 1], lst[i]
        swapped = True

  # Return the sorted list
  return lst
```

Note that the default functionality is to parse ChatGPT responses as markdown using [html-to-md](https://github.com/stonehank/html-to-md). I've found the markdown quality to be excellent in my testing, but if you'd rather output plaintext, just pass `{ markdown: false }` to the `ChatGPTAPI` constructor.
